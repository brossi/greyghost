## Ideas

 * [Blazecut fire supression system](http://jogrusa.com/products/blazecut-fire-suppression-system)
 * Sound deadening on the pans before installing the interior
 * Research what it would take to include a sway bar for improved stability and handling
 * 12v wiper conversion and washers
 * Improved head, tail, and brake lighting (LED?)
 * Shift the position of the battery from the engine compartment to under the shelf behind the passenger's seat
